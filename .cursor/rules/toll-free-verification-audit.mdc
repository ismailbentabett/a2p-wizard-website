# Toll-Free SMS Verification Audit Rule

When the user asks to run the Toll-Free verification audit, audit this website codebase end-to-end for Toll-Free verification readiness and generate:

1. A PASS/FAIL checklist (with line-item findings)
2. A full audit report using the exact "Report Creator" structure in `docs/TF_VERIFICATION_AUDIT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`
3. A prioritized fix list with concrete edits needed in each file

## Scope

- Toll-Free verification only (NOT 10DLC, NOT short codes).
- Assume the verification category is Customer Care unless the site explicitly enables marketing SMS.
- References: A2P Toll-Free Verification Guide; GoHighLevel Toll-Free verification SOP; GoHighLevel LC Phone TF verification article (web form opt-in CTA disclosures, checkbox not pre-checked, checkbox not required to submit).

## Files to Audit

- index.html
- about.html
- services.html
- contact.html
- sms.html
- privacy.html
- terms.html
- shared JS/CSS (script.js, style.css, legal.css)

## Audit Rules (Strict)

### A) Website identity

- Brand/Legal Entity consistency: company name, domain, contact email, phone, address must match across pages.

### B) Required legal pages

- Footer must link to Privacy, Terms, SMS Program on all pages.

### C) Forms collecting phone numbers

Audit every form. If phone input exists, verify:

- A required Terms/Privacy agreement checkbox (no SMS text inside).
- A separate OPTIONAL SMS consent checkbox (unchecked by default).
- SMS consent disclosure must include ALL:
  1. business/brand name
  2. message purpose (customer care vs marketing)
  3. "Message & data rates may apply"
  4. frequency disclosure with a cap (e.g. "Message frequency may vary, up to 4 msgs/month" or equivalent)
  5. STOP opt-out instruction
  6. HELP instruction
  7. "Consent is not a condition of purchase"
- Terms and Privacy links should be near the opt-in area (not inside the checkbox label if possible).
- If phone field is optional, SMS consent must still be explicit if SMS is offered; if phone field is required, consent still cannot be forced for marketing unless explicitly designed and documented.

### D) Consistency

- Frequency language must match across sms.html, privacy.html, terms.html, and form disclosure.
- STOP/HELP language must match across all.

### E) Message samples

- Provide 2 compliant sample messages for Customer Care that include brand + STOP, and avoid public shorteners.

## Output Required

1. **Checklist table:** item, PASS/FAIL, evidence (file + snippet), fix (exact edit).
2. **Full report** using the template at `docs/TF_VERIFICATION_AUDIT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` (Business/Brand, Sections A–F, Final Risk Assessment).
3. **Fix Pack** section listing exact code changes per file, in order (contact.html, index.html, sms.html, privacy.html, terms.html, script.js as applicable), including exact replacement text for the SMS consent disclosure paragraph where needed.

## Edge Cases

- If a form exists on multiple pages, ensure every instance is corrected.
- If JS enforces consent in a way that violates "checkbox cannot be required," flag it and propose compliant alternatives.
- If marketing language exists in SMS consent or SMS pages, either remove it (Customer Care-only) or require Marketing category alignment; do not assume marketing unless consent language indicates it.
- If opt-in proof is behind login or not public, propose a public screenshot hosting approach.
